## Course Information

Network management remains the least understood aspect of networking.
Managers of today's enterprise and carrier networks face great challenges, as they need to manage a variety of devices, protocols and mechanisms, to meet a diverse set of goals in performance, security, availability and costs.
This course provides students with a comprehensive view of the network management problem, including its concepts, scope, challenges, and techniques.
We will study the network management concepts in concrete applications and scenarios such as MPLS, VPN, VLAN, etc.
As a highlight of this course, we will also spend significant amount of time studying emerging networking technologies such as Software Defined Networking, to better prepare students for managing future IT infrastructures.
